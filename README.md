# 🕰️ JavaScript & CSS Clock

This is a **fully functional analog clock** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It dynamically updates in real-time using JavaScript's `Date` object and rotates the clock hands accordingly.

## 🚀 Features

- **Live Time Update**: The clock hands update every second based on the current time.
- **Smooth Hand Movement**: Uses CSS transitions for fluid animation.
- **Fully Responsive**: Works on different screen sizes.
- **Stylish UI**: Includes a modern glassy clock face with a gradient background.
- **Future Improvement**: The second-hand transition reset at `59 → 0` will be optimized later.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the clock.
- **CSS**: Styling and smooth animations.
- **JavaScript**: Time logic and dynamic movement.
